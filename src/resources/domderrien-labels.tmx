		<note>
			This TMX file is the master repository for the English labels used in the Olympia application.
			The content is edited by the developers who generate the unique identifiers, the notes for the
			translators, the label/message to be displayed, and custom tags used by the build system.

			This is the unique repository containing:
			  - Information used by the browser-part of the application (dojo tech stack),
			  - Information used by the webtier-part of the application (Java tech stack),
			  - Information used by the layout system (Java tech stack in 7.1-can be pushed dojo-side later).

			This TMX is submitted to the translation department and this entity returns many others TMX files,
			as many as languages required for the product.

			Labels and messages defined in this TMX files and its localized versions are published at build time:
			  - As properties files to be handled by the PropertiesResourceBundle class,
			  - As JavaScript files defining simple maps.
			The target type is chosen thanks to the custom property: <prop type="x-tier"/>

			Note to developers:
			  1) When the usage of one label occurs many time, don't hesitate to define many entries if you think
				 that the context is different.
			  2) If the usage of the custom tags <prop/> is important for the build process, giving information
				 to the translators via the tag <note/> is also very important for the overall quality of the
				 product. Don't hesitate to link entries if the labels/messages are related. Don't hesitate to
				 give samples to illustrate your comments.
			  3) Be sure to generate unique identifiers. Be consistent the unique identifier format.
			  4) All text inserted in the <seg/> tag is rendered as is. Take care of the return-to-line and spacing.

			IMPORTANT NOTES:
			  1) Everything rendered between the tags <seg> and </seg> are rendered. So be careful to NOT insert
				 return-to-line or extra spaces.
			  2) Forbidden characters are : ampersand, quotes, double-quotes, less-than. and greater-than signs
			     Their unicode value MUST be used in place:
			         - ampersand: \u0026
			         - double quotes: \u0022
			         - less than: \u003c
			         - greater than: \u003e
			         - non break space: \u00a0
			     Note that using th single quote is safe.
			  3) All messages being displayed in a Web browser, it's possible to use HTML sequences, but they MUST
				 be escaped correctly: "<b></b>" should become: "\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e". Other HTML codes
				 (like &mdash;) are safe as the corresponding UTF-8 sequence.

				IMPORTANT: Native transcription of the language (e.g. Dansk, Deutsch, English).
				IMPORTANT: "English" should not be just translated!
				IMPORTANT: If the rest of the xml:lang attribute is left with the value "en", it's crucial
				           to update the one of this entry with the correct value (e.g. fr, it, zh_CN, etc.).

					As a writer, it's

					Gotcha?
